## Status

Mech is currently under active development on GitLab:

- [Core](https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/core) - A small dataflow engine that accepts transactions of changes, and applies them to a compute network.
- [Server](https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/server) - Hosts Mech cores for connected clients. 
- [Notebook](https://gitlab.com/mech-lang/notebook) - A graphical interface that connects to a Mech server.

The status of the project is **pre-alpha** meaning the project is in a perpetual state of being broken. I will invite others to start collaborating on the project when we reach the v0.0.1-alpha milestone.
