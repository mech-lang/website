title: Mech So Far

[Last week](https://mechlang.net/post/2018-06-07-hello-world/) I spent the post  describing Mech in aspirational terms, focusing more on what Mech should be, while glossing past the implementation specifics on how to achieve those ambitions.

This week I'll fill in those blanks, and talk more about the Mech's architecture, implementation, and where we are currently in the development process. If you haven't read the previous post, got read that first, because I'll be referring to it a lot in this article.
