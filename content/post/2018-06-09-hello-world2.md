Welcome to the inaugural post of the Mech language blog, where I will be sharing updates on the project. On this first post, I will just talk a little about what the language is for, and where I'll be taking it in the near future. In subsequent posts I'll focus more on the history of the project, where it fits in with other similar projects, and the various unique properties of the language.

I'll start by saying the language doesn't even have a syntax yet, so that should give you an idea about how early this project is.
