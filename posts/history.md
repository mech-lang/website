## History

First, a little about me. My name is Corey and I got my start in programming languages working on the Eve project with Chris Granger, Rob Attorri, Josh Cole, Jamie Brandon, and Eric Hoffman. Eve is a special language, because it throws out the programming language orthodoxy and approaches the act of programming from an almost contrarian perspective.

We traditionally think of the act of programming as one where an individual endeavors to create programs, apps, or software -- a package of code that is self contained and works to perform a coherent function. Eve took a step back and said "Wait. Why are we creating software in the first place? Software is incidental to the process; what people really want to do is answer questions using data that is personal to themselves."
