Barriers to new learners:


- double equality == -> leads to logic errors.
- zero index -> leads to off-by-one errors
- line terminating semicolons -> hard to spot errors sometimes
- integers versus floats, and even different length representations -> leads to calculation errors and confusion over which size to choose.
- implicit function arguments -> hard to read code, need to read it in an IDE or with a reference to understand what's going on.
- Impure functions -> leads to unexpected behavior
- Storage -> where to put stuff?
- little syntax bits
